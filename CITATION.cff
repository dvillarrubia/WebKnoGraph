  WebKnoGraph is an open research project that uses data processing,
  vector embeddings, and graph algorithms to optimize internal linking
  at scale. Built for both academic and industry use, it offers the first
  fully transparent, AI-driven framework for improving SEO and site
  navigation through reproducible methods. The project revolutionizes
  website internal linking by leveraging cutting-edge data processing
  techniques, vector embeddings, and graph-based link prediction algorithms.
